[title]The closed bottle

The rim of the lid is notched and I struggle to open it. Of course, it's a pill bottle. This is a child safety lid. But in my feeble state it takes all of my concentration to force the thing open.

Inside, there are no pills. Just one capsule at the bottom of the bottle, filled with a pearly liquid. I hold it between two fingers, and some viscous fluid within glimmers ominously in the flourescent light. Why I shiver, I don't know.

[choice] This unknown capsule...
