[title] For the best

Eyeing that opalescent shimmer, I move the capsule to my mouth, then swallow. The pill goes down slowly, without protest, tasting like an off-color apple.

There's only a minute to wait. The tension in my muscles disappears. I've never been so conscious of my breathing, or the soft pulse of my heart. Both grow fainter. The room is sideways, the flourescent lighting again dulled by the table? My eyelids? Panic seems foreign. I'm convinced this is euphoria. As everything softens, I will my breath and out once a minute. Twice a minute? Why? Just so I can be conscious I've found a way out? I'll stop forcing my lungs to work and... rest.

There is more than one way to escape from this place.
