[title] Foreign substance

I hold the bottle to my nose, but there's no scent. As I fish out one of the tablets, I notice the orange dust on my finger tips. Of course, this wasn't there before... Was it? Can't remember.

Holding the tablet in the light, it appears innocent. But that powder... It must be nothing, right?
